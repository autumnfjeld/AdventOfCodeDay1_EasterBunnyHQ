# Advent of Code Day1: EasterBunnyHQ App

This repo is a solution to the Advent of Code problem posed [here](http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/1).


The solution is written as a node app.  
The EasterBunnyHQ app computes the shortest distance, in number of blocks on a [Cartesian city grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry), to the Easter Bunny HQ . 
To run the app locally you must have node installed.



### Instructions to run this app
 * Clone or download this repo
 * In your terminal, `cd` to the root directory and run:  `npm install`
 * To run the app with the given (hardcoded) input:  `npm run goBunny`
    * The minimim number of blocks Dr. Bunny could travel to reach Easter Bunny HQ is reported in your terminal.
 * To run the tests with the [example data](http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/1):  `npm test`
